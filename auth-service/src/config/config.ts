To improve the TypeScript code, you can add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the `port` constant. This makes the code more readable and helps prevent accidental type changes in the future. Here's the improved code:

```typescript
export const port: number = 3000;
```

This explicitly states that `port` is a number, which is a good practice for clarity and type safety.
