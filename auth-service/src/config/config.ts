The provided TypeScript code is a simple export statement that defines a constant `port` with a value of `3000`. This is a straightforward and correct way to export a constant in TypeScript. However, there are a few improvements and considerations you might want to take into account depending on the context in which this code is used:

1. **Documentation**: Add a comment to explain what this port is used for. This can be helpful for other developers or for future reference.

   ```typescript
   // The default port for the server to listen on
   export const port = 3000;
   ```

2. **Configuration Management**: If this port number is likely to change based on the environment (e.g., development, testing, production), consider using environment variables or a configuration file to manage it.

   ```typescript
   export const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) : 3000;
   ```

3. **Type Safety**: Ensure that the port number is always a valid number. The above example with `parseInt` handles this by converting the environment variable to a number.

4. **Naming Conventions**: If this constant is part of a larger module or application, consider using a more descriptive name to avoid potential conflicts and improve readability.

   ```typescript
   export const SERVER_PORT = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) : 3000;
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: If using environment variables, consider adding error handling to manage cases where the environment variable is not a valid number.

   ```typescript
   const portFromEnv = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) : 3000;
   if (isNaN(portFromEnv)) {
       throw new Error(`Invalid port number: ${process.env.PORT}`);
   }
   export const SERVER_PORT = portFromEnv;
   ```

These improvements can make your code more robust, flexible, and easier to maintain.
