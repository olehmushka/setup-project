The provided TypeScript code sets up an Express server with basic configuration. Here are some improvements and considerations:

1. **Use Built-in Middleware**: As of Express 4.16.0, `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` are built-in middleware functions, so there's no need to use `body-parser` separately.

2. **Type Safety**: Ensure that the `port` imported from the configuration is of type `number` to avoid runtime errors.

3. **Error Handling**: Consider adding basic error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors gracefully.

4. **Environment Variables**: If `port` is not defined in the configuration, consider using a default value or reading from environment variables.

5. **Modularization**: If the application grows, consider separating concerns by moving routes and middleware into separate modules.

Here's the improved code:

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { port } from './config/config';

const app = express();

// Ensure port is a number
const serverPort: number = typeof port === 'number' ? port : 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Basic error handling middleware
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

// Set port and export server
app.set('port', serverPort);
export const server = app;
```

### Additional Recommendations:

- **Logging**: Consider using a logging library like `morgan` for better request logging.
- **Security**: Use security middleware like `helmet` to set various HTTP headers for security.
- **CORS**: If your API will be accessed from different origins, consider configuring CORS using the `cors` middleware.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your server setup to ensure it behaves as expected. Use tools like `Jest` or `Mocha` for testing.
- **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints and server setup for easier maintenance and onboarding of new developers.
