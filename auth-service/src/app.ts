Here are some improvements to the TypeScript code:

1. **Error Handling**: Add error handling for the client connections.
2. **Async/Await**: If `getRedisClient` and `getSqlClient` are asynchronous, use `await` to ensure they are resolved before being used.
3. **Type Annotations**: Add type annotations for better type safety and readability.
4. **Code Organization**: Separate concerns and improve readability.

Here's the improved code:

```typescript
import { server } from './server';
import { getClient as getRedisClient } from './lib/redis/redis';
import { getClient as getSqlClient } from './lib/sql/sql';
import { getPasswordAuthHandlers } from './handlers/factory/password-auth';

async function initializeApp() {
  try {
    const redisClient = await getRedisClient();
    const sqlClient = await getSqlClient();

    const authHandlers = getPasswordAuthHandlers(redisClient, sqlClient);

    return server.use('/auth', authHandlers);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to initialize app:', error);
    process.exit(1); // Exit the process with an error code
  }
}

export const app = initializeApp();
```

### Key Improvements:

- **Async Initialization**: Wrapped the initialization logic in an `async` function to handle asynchronous operations properly.
- **Error Handling**: Added a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during client initialization.
- **Process Exit**: Used `process.exit(1)` to terminate the application if initialization fails, indicating an error state.
- **Code Clarity**: Separated the initialization logic into a function for better organization and readability.
